# Javascript Data Types Exercises

> This worksheet will double as Javascript notes for future reference! Copy it into your preferred note-taking program at the end of class.

## Data Types

For each expression, predict what you think the output will be in a comment (`//`) ***without first running the command***. Then run the expression in the console. Note the actual output in a comment and compare it with your prediction.

#### Example

```js
typeof("potato")
// Prediction: Vegetable
// Actual: String
```

What is the output of each of the expressions below?

```js
typeof(15)
// Prediction:
// Actual:

typeof(5.5)
// Prediction:
// Actual:

typeof(NaN)
// Prediction:
// Actual:

typeof("hello")
// Prediction:
// Actual:

typeof(true)
// Prediction:
// Actual:

typeof(1 != 2)
// Prediction:
// Actual:


"hamburger" + "s"
// Prediction:
// Actual:

"hamburgers" - "s"
// Prediction:
// Actual:

"1" + "3"
// Prediction:
// Actual:

"1" - "3"
// Prediction:
// Actual:

"johnny" + 5
// Prediction:
// Actual:

"johnny" - 5
// Prediction:
// Actual:

99 * "luftbaloons"
// Prediction:
// Actual:
```

What's going on in the second half of the previous question? Are there any "rules" we can pull from those examples?

## Data Structures

> Data structures include arrays and objects. We will go over objects in a later class.

### Arrays

Javascript provides us with a number of native methods that allow us to interact with arrays. Find methods that do each of the following and provide an example...
* Add an element to the back of an array.
* Remove an element from the back of an array.
* Add an element to the front of an array.
* Remove an element from the front of an array.
* Concatenates all the elements in an array into a string.
* Separates the characters of a string into an array. This one is a string method.

> This is a great exercise for practicing your "Google Fu"! If you need a starting point, check out [MDN's documentation page on arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array).

What will the contents of the below arrays be after the code samples are executed? Come up with an answer yourself before testing it out in the console.

```js
var numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8]
numbers.pop()
numbers.push(10)
numbers.unshift(3)
```

```text
Your answer goes here.
```

What is the return value of the below code sample? Come up with an answer yourself before testing it out in the console.

```js
var morse = ["dot", "pause", "dot"]
var moreMorse = morse.join(" dash ")
moreMorse.split(" ")
```

```text

```

What will the contents of the below array be after the below code sample is executed? Come up with an answer yourself before testing it out in the console.

```js
var bands = []
var beatles = ["Paul", "John", "George", "Pete"]
var stones = ["Brian", "Mick", "Keith", "Ronnie", "Charlie"]
bands.push(beatles)
bands.unshift(stones)
bands[bands.length - 1].pop()
bands[0].shift()
bands[1][3] = "Ringo"
```

```text

```
### Objects
```
var phoneBook = {
  "Abe": "111-111-1111",
  "Bob": "222-222-2222",
  "Cam": "333-333-3333",
  "Dan": "444-444-4444",
  "Ern": "555-555-5555",
  "Fry": "111-111-1111",
  "Gil": "222-222-2222",
  "Hal": "333-333-3333",
  "Ike": "444-444-4444",
  "Jim": "555-555-5555",
  "Kip": "111-111-1111",
  "Liv": "222-222-2222",
  "Mia": "333-333-3333",
  "Nik": "444-444-4444",
  "Oli": "555-555-5555",
  "Pam": "111-111-1111",
  "Qiq": "222-222-2222",
  "Rob": "333-333-3333",
  "Stu": "444-444-4444",
  "Tad": "555-555-5555",
  "Uwe": "111-111-1111",
  "Val": "222-222-2222",
  "Wil": "333-333-3333",
  "Xiu": "444-444-4444",
  "Yam": "555-555-5555",
  "Zed": "111-111-1111"
};
```

Write a line of code that accesses the phone number for Pam.

Write a line of code that creates a new record for John at 435-567-1223.

Write your own object and console.log that value.

Find out what `Object.keys(phoneBook)` does.

Look up and use the `delete` keyword with phoneBook to delete a record.
